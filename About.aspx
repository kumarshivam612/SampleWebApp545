    <p>Determining which application pattern or patterns to use for your SQL-Server-based applications 
        in Azure environment is an important design decision and it requires a solid understanding of 
        how SQL Server and each infrastructure component of Azure work together. With SQL Server in Azure 
        Infrastructure Services, you can easily migrate, maintain, and monitor your existing SQL Server 
        applications built-on Windows Server to virtual machines in Azure.</p>
